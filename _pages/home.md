We are team of the [ISISLab](https://www.isislab.it/), based at the [University of Salerno](https://www.unisa.it).
Our interests span from high-level programming models for HPC and embedded systems, to energy-efficient computing and performance optimization on various layers of the HPC stack.

**Programming models for HPC.**
Modern HPC systems are difficult to program.
Our research focuses on high-level programming models, capable to transparently handle data and task parallelism as well as heterogeneity, and to scale on large-scale compute clusters equipped with GPUs and other accelerators.
Our work on programming models also focuses on the Message Passing Interface (MPI), in particular on integrating modern C++ features into existing message passing implementations. 

**Energy-efficient computing.**
Software often exposes parameters that affect both energy consumption and performance.
In our research we exploit different techniques and technologies to enhance the energy efficiency of HPC systems, allowing for the exploration of new opportunities in optimizing applications' energy consumption.
Reducing energy consumption typically leads to a trade-off with performance; therefore, we have a multi-objective problem, where we can explore different trade-offs.
Our research also focuses on providing the user with a simple and portable interface that facilitates the selection of the best energy-efficient solution without exposing technical details.

**Approximate computing.**
Many applications provide inherent resilience to some amount of error and can potentially trade accuracy for performance.
Our research is focused on software approaches for approximate computing, such as mixed precision, data and kernel perforation, relaxed synchronization and the applications of these techniques to CPUs, GPUs and other accelerators.
